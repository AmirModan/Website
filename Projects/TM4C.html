              <h2>Smart Home Security System</h2>
              <p>When we were first tasked with implementing an Embedded System using the TM4C123 Microcontroller, we wanted to develop a low-cost, yet practical device that solves an issue common in many societies, Home Burglary.</p>
              <p>Because there are already several professional security systems on the market today with prices starting at over a hundred dollars, we wanted our security system to be extremely cost-effective so that anyone, especially poorer communities in which burglary is most rampant, can utilize our technology.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we will use several low-cost, yet accurate peripherals that will help detect signs of burglary as well as preventing it, all being controlled by the Tiva Board.</p>
              <p>The Tiva Board will also interface with a Raspberry Pi in order to add more advanced features to the Security System.</p>
