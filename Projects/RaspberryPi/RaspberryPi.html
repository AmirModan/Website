            <p>This project was the result of me trying to create a light show using the Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p>A button is used to alternate between each of the 16 cases showed in the video.</p>
            <p>The first 8 cases were created soley using loops to iterate which led was on at a given moment.</p>
            <p>The second 8 cases were like the first 8, except that pulse width modulation (PWM) was used to brighten all led's to some degree, with the brightest being where the "pulse" was located.</p>
            <p>The RGB light on the right has its own program where it uses PWM to cycle through the entire color spectrum.</p>

            <p>In this project, a fan is periodically spun in different directions using a DC Motor.
              This could not have been done without the use of the integrated circuit (IC) L293D.</p>
