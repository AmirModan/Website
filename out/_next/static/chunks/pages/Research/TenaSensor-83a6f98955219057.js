To improve post-stroke outcomes in LMICs, researchers have sought to leverage emerging technologies that overcome traditional barriers associated with stroke management. One such technology, inertial measurement units (IMUs), exhibit great potential as a low-cost, portable means to evaluate and monitor patient progress during decentralized rehabilitation protocols. As such, the aim of the present study was to determine the ability of a low-cost single IMU sensor-based wearable system (named the T'ena sensor) to reliably and accurately assess movement quality and efficiency in physically and neurologically healthy adults. Upper limb movement kinematics measured by the T'ena sensor were compared to the gold standard reference system during three functional tasks, and root mean square errors, Pearson's correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation coefficients, and the Bland Altman method were used to compare kinematic variables of interest between the two systems for absolute accuracy and equivalency. The T'ena sensor and the gold standard reference system were significantly correlated for all tasks and measures (r range = 0.648—0.947), although less so for the Finger to Nose task (r range = 0.648—0.894). Results demonstrate that single IMU systems are a valid, reliable, and objective method by which to measure movement kinematics during functional tasks.

Wearable technologies are a cost-effective means by which to monitor and provide feedback about sensorimotor function across the different phases of stroke recovery, with insights improving decision-making by rehabilitation clinicians and increasing accountability and motivation for the patient. In this paper, we design and evaluate a wearable sensor system that measures movement kinematics during the performance of activities of daily living. Results indicate high to very high agreement and correlation values between the sensor and the gold-standard motion capture system, regardless of kinematic parameter. In sum, the described sensor is capable of accurately measuring upper limb movement kinematics, using only a single sensor.
