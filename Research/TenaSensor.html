          <p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with a
            disproportionate burden represented by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To
            improve post-stroke outcomes in LMICs, researchers have sought to leverage emerging
            technologies that overcome traditional barriers associated with stroke management. One
            such technology, inertial measurement units (IMUs), exhibit great potential as a low-cost,
            portable means to evaluate and monitor patient progress during decentralized
            rehabilitation protocols. As such, the aim of the present study was to determine the
            ability of a low-cost single IMU sensor-based wearable system (named the T'ena sensor) to
            reliably and accurately assess movement quality and efficiency in physically and
            neurologically healthy adults. Upper limb movement kinematics measured by the T'ena
            sensor were compared to the gold standard reference system during three functional
            tasks, and root mean square errors, Pearson's correlation coefficients, intraclass
            correlation coefficients, and the Bland Altman method were used to compare
            kinematic variables of interest between the two systems for absolute accuracy and
            equivalency. The T'ena sensor and the gold standard reference system were
            significantly correlated for all tasks and measures (r range = 0.648—0.947), although
            less so for the Finger to Nose task (r range = 0.648—0.894). Results demonstrate that
            single IMU systems are a valid, reliable, and objective method by which to measure
            movement kinematics during functional tasks. Context-appropriate enabling technologies
            specifically designed to address barriers to quality health services in LMICs can accelerate
            progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.</p>

      <h2>Design and Evaluation of an IMU Sensor-based System for the Rehabilitation of Upper Limb Motor Dysfunction
      </h2>

        <div class="image-container">
          <p>Stroke is one of the most significant noncommunicable diseases in the world with approximately 15
            million people experiencing a new or recurrent stroke each
            year. Nearly half of stroke survivors have some degree
            of permanent sensorimotor impairment and require specialized
            rehabilitation. Wearable technologies are a cost-effective means
            by which to monitor and provide feedback about sensorimotor
            function across the different phases of stroke recovery, with
            insights improving decision-making by rehabilitation clinicians
            and increasing accountability and motivation for the patient. In
            this paper, we design and evaluate a wearable sensor system that
            measures movement kinematics during the performance of
            activities of daily living. Results indicate high to very high
            agreement and correlation values between the sensor and the
            gold-standard motion capture system, regardless of kinematic
            parameter. In sum, the described sensor is capable of accurately
            measuring upper limb movement kinematics, using only a single
            sensor. The adoption of portable and low-cost devices have the
            ability to make a substantial impact for the millions of persons
            who exhibit motor impairments after a stroke.</p>
