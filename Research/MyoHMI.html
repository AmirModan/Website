          <p>Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal is a bioelectric signal that measures muscle activities by surface
            electrodes placed on the skin and is effective for representing movement intentions. Myoelectric-controlled
            human-machine interfaces (HMIs) utilize sEMG signals from the userâ€™s muscles to identify what the user is
            doing physically and can relay this action to control an output device such as a prosthetic limb or a
            gesture-controlled application. The aim of this project is to enhance a previously developed Android-based
            mobile computing platform named mMyoHMI, to provide a portable, low-cost, and flexible solution for sEMG
            pattern recognition-based myoelectric-controlled applications. The mMyoHMI platform seamlessly integrates a
            variety of interfacing and signal processing modules from data acquisition through pattern recognition to
            real-time evaluation and control. The enhanced MyoHMI app improves the input interface module to make it
            flexible to collect sEMG signals from many different types of sensors via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and has
            made the first attempt to integrate deep learning methods on a mobile device for real-time sEMG pattern
            classification.
